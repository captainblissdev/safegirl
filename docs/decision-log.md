# Decision Log

## 2026-08-20
- **Decision:** RAG framework = LlamaIndex over LangChain. 
  Rationale: RAG-first design, more stable API, faster path within 7-week timeline.
- **Decision:** Generation LLM = Gemini (Google AI Studio free tier) over Azure/Claude.
  Rationale: renewing daily quota fits repeated eval/generation runs better than a 
  fixed depleting credit balance. Caveat logged: free-tier prompts may be used by 
  Google to improve their models — no real user/PII data will ever be sent.
- **Decision:** KDHS treated as contextual/demographic evidence only, never as 
  source for individual clinical KB answers. MOH/WHO are the clinical authorities.
- **Decision:** KB built entry-by-entry from verified evidence, not generated in bulk.
- **Decision:** Source hierarchy = Kenya MoH (primary, service delivery) > WHO 
  (supporting clinical/rights guidance) > KDHS (context only).

## 2026-08-21

Completed:
- Processed and verified NotebookLM Prompt 0 evidence.
- Established the source evidence map.
- Identified and documented the EC timing discrepancy between Kenya MoH and WHO guidance.
- Identified unresolved legal and clinical claims requiring review.
- Drafted five initial source-grounded knowledge-base entries:
  - KB-C1 — Adolescent contraceptive eligibility
  - KB-C2 — Parental/guardian authorization
  - KB-S1 — HIV testing/self-testing
  - KB-S2 — PEP after possible HIV exposure
  - KB-G1 — Privacy/confidentiality at youth-friendly services.

Decisions:
- Unresolved clinical, legal, and safety-sensitive claims will not enter dataset seeds.
- KDHS remains primarily contextual evidence.
- Current Kenyan legal requirements will not be inferred from the 2005 YFS guideline.
- The EC 72-hour/120-hour discrepancy remains open for supervisor/domain-expert review.

Current status:
- Prompt 0: CLOSED
- Initial KB: 5 entries drafted
- Dataset generation: NOT STARTED
- Fine-tuning: NOT STARTED

## 2026-08-27
- **Superseding freeze:** Replaced 2026-08-20 baseline with expanded version 
  (Captain-authored). Full changelog per new file docstring: removed standalone 
  "period" (fixed false-positive on general menstrual questions), removed 
  broad "symptoms" from STI, added high-signal phrasing across all classes, 
  scoped ML evaluation explicitly to 4 classes (GBV routing-only, per R8).
- **Pre-freeze regression (round 2):** Found 2 regressions introduced by the 
  above changes — (1) "birth control...without parents knowing" misrouted to 
  general due to overlapping/double-counting parental-consent phrases outscoring 
  the single contraception hit; (2) "period isn't here" phrasing lost all 
  pregnancy signal after "period" removal, zero-hit fallback to general.
- **Fixes applied:** removed redundant "parents knowing"/"parent knowing" 
  general keywords (overlap with "without my parents"); added "period isn't 
  here"/"period is not here" to pregnancy.
- **Final regression: 58/58 (100%)** across all previously-cleared seeds plus 
  today's additions. Verified before freeze, not after.
- **Open scope question (not yet resolved, not blocking freeze):** fertility-
  awareness/natural-method keywords (ovulation, safe days, calendar method) 
  route correctly but have no grounded KB source. Same category of decision 
  as puberty-topic scoping — needs an explicit in/out call before any KB 
  content or seeds are written for this subtopic.

  ## 2026-08-28 (cont.)
- **4.3 CONFIRMED via Colab run:** tokenizer loaded live (distilbert-base-multilingual-cased),
  tokenization verified correct ([CLS]...[SEP][PAD] structure), leakage check 
  passed, split assignment matched sandbox test exactly (seed=42 determinism 
  confirmed across environments). No pip installs beyond transformers/sklearn/
  pandas needed; no file uploads required (smoke test uses inline dummy data).
- **STATUS: Step 4 (Methodology) — fully closed.** Baseline frozen, split 
  methodology confirmed, classifier skeleton verified working end-to-end.

  ## 2026-08-28 (cont.)
- **Step 5 CONFIRMED:** LlamaIndex (0.14.24) and sentence-transformers (5.7.0) 
  installed and imported successfully in the same Colab session as the 
  classifier environment. Classifier tokenizer re-verified working after 
  install — no breaking conflict.
- **Noted, non-blocking:** pip flagged a missing `jedi>=0.16` dependency 
  (IPython autocomplete only, unrelated to ML functionality) during install. 
  Not investigated further as it doesn't affect model/tokenizer/retrieval 
  functionality. Revisit only if interactive Colab behavior becomes an issue.
- **STATUS: Step 5 — closed.** Do NOT build the RAG pipeline yet — import 
  check only, per today's scope.

## 2026-08-28
- **Diagram #1 — final asset swap:** Replaced matplotlib-rendered SVG/PNG 
  with a native hand-coded SVG version (cleaner vector output, UC-numbered 
  labels matching use-case-specifications.md exactly). Fixed one wording 
  drift before adoption: guard condition read "[distress/GBV/crisis detected]", 
  corrected to canonical "[distress/GBV/crisis language detected]" to match 
  the spec doc and .drawio source. Verified via XML validity check and visual 
  re-render post-fix — no overflow, clean fit.
- **Diagram #1: CLOSED, FINAL.** .drawio remains the editable source of truth; 
  .svg/.png are the presentation exports.

## 2026-08-29
- **Decision:** Proceed with Gemini API as generation LLM despite verified 
  ToS conflict (age/consumer-use restrictions).
- **Rationale:** SafeGirl is an academic prototype built to supplement 
  research (classifier evaluation, RAG methodology, safety-net design) — 
  not a live, publicly deployed consumer product reaching real adolescent 
  end users during the current project period. Actual usage during 
  development and evaluation is confined to the developer, supervisor, and 
  domain expert testing against synthetic/seed data, not real minors 
  interacting with the system unsupervised.
- **Mitigation:** limit real usage during project period to synthetic/
  adult-tester queries; document explicitly in limitations section; raise 
  with supervisor for sign-off; note production deployment would require 
  resolving this before any real-world release (self-hosted model or 
  compliance-consent framework).
- **Not resolved, deliberately deferred:** production-readiness question. 
  This decision applies to the academic research prototype scope only.
