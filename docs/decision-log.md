# Decision Log

## 2026-08-20
- **Decision:** RAG framework = LlamaIndex over LangChain. 
  Rationale: RAG-first design, more stable API, faster path within 7-week timeline.
- **Decision:** Generation LLM = Gemini (Google AI Studio free tier) over Azure/Claude.
  Rationale: renewing daily quota fits repeated eval/generation runs better than a 
  fixed depleting credit balance. Caveat logged: free-tier prompts may be used by 
  Google to improve their models — no real user/PII data will ever be sent.
- **Decision:** KDHS treated as contextual/demographic evidence only, never as 
  source for individual clinical KB answers. MOH/WHO are the clinical authorities.
- **Decision:** KB built entry-by-entry from verified evidence, not generated in bulk.
- **Decision:** Source hierarchy = Kenya MoH (primary, service delivery) > WHO 
  (supporting clinical/rights guidance) > KDHS (context only).
