# Decision Log

## 2026-08-20
- **Decision:** RAG framework = LlamaIndex over LangChain. 
  Rationale: RAG-first design, more stable API, faster path within 7-week timeline.
- **Decision:** Generation LLM = Gemini (Google AI Studio free tier) over Azure/Claude.
  Rationale: renewing daily quota fits repeated eval/generation runs better than a 
  fixed depleting credit balance. Caveat logged: free-tier prompts may be used by 
  Google to improve their models — no real user/PII data will ever be sent.
- **Decision:** KDHS treated as contextual/demographic evidence only, never as 
  source for individual clinical KB answers. MOH/WHO are the clinical authorities.
- **Decision:** KB built entry-by-entry from verified evidence, not generated in bulk.
- **Decision:** Source hierarchy = Kenya MoH (primary, service delivery) > WHO 
  (supporting clinical/rights guidance) > KDHS (context only).

Completed:
- Processed and verified NotebookLM Prompt 0 evidence.
- Established the source evidence map.
- Identified and documented the EC timing discrepancy between Kenya MoH and WHO guidance.
- Identified unresolved legal and clinical claims requiring review.
- Drafted five initial source-grounded knowledge-base entries:
  - KB-C1 — Adolescent contraceptive eligibility
  - KB-C2 — Parental/guardian authorization
  - KB-S1 — HIV testing/self-testing
  - KB-S2 — PEP after possible HIV exposure
  - KB-G1 — Privacy/confidentiality at youth-friendly services.

Decisions:
- Unresolved clinical, legal, and safety-sensitive claims will not enter dataset seeds.
- KDHS remains primarily contextual evidence.
- Current Kenyan legal requirements will not be inferred from the 2005 YFS guideline.
- The EC 72-hour/120-hour discrepancy remains open for supervisor/domain-expert review.

Current status:
- Prompt 0: CLOSED
- Initial KB: 5 entries drafted
- Dataset generation: NOT STARTED
- Fine-tuning: NOT STARTED
